# SUSTech CS310 Natural Language Processing

This course provides a thorough introduction to the technology of natural language processing (NLP) and the research field of computational linguistics (CL). 

The two terms, NLP and CL, while mostly used interchangeably, carry slightly different meanings in this course: NLP refers to the technology that enable computers with the capability of processing, understanding, and producing human language in intellectual ways, and thus, is more application-oriented. CL refers to the inter-disciplinary research field that study human languages with computational methods, from multiple perspectives, such as physiology, psychology, linguistics, cognitive sciences, culture and humanity etc., and thus is more theory-flavored. 

This course covers a weighted mixture of NLP (70%) and CL (30%), including topics such as the computational word semantics, the extraction of structural text information, automatic translation, question answering, dialogue with user inputs, psycholinguistics, cognitive sciences, and many more. This course focus on teaching the fundamentals, with self-contained lectures and associated readings and implementation practices.
