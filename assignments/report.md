```

From the training process, we can observe:

- The model achieved its best F1 score (0.7202) at epoch 2

- The loss value continuously decreased from 0.9756 to 0.6348

- The F1 score fluctuated after epoch 2 but showed an overall upward trend



##### Final Test Results

The final F1 score on the test set is: 0.9412

This result indicates:

- The model performed excellently on the test set, achieving an F1 score of 0.9412
- Compared to the best F1 score on the development set (0.7202), the test set performance is better, demonstrating good generalization ability
- No significant overfitting was observed, as the test set performance exceeds the development set performance



##### Conclusion

The NER model achieved good performance after just 5 epochs of training, ultimately attaining an F1 score of 0.9412 on the test set, proving its strong capability in named entity recognition. The model showed stable performance during training, with no significant signs of overfitting or underfitting.

#### 4. Implement the maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM). 

The MEMM implementation involves the following key steps:

1. Architecture Design:
   - Create an embedding layer for NER tags
   - Use BiLSTM for processing input sequences
   - Add a transition layer to model tag dependencies

2. Forward Pass:
   - First encode input sequence using BiLSTM
   - For each timestep t:
     - Concatenate BiLSTM output with previous tag embedding
     - Pass through feed-forward layers
     - Apply softmax to get tag probabilities

3. Training Process:
   - Use teacher forcing during training
   - Feed gold standard previous tags
   - Optimize using cross entropy loss

4. Key Differences from Basic Model:
   - Incorporates tag history through embeddings
   - Models sequential dependencies explicitly
   - More complex but potentially more accurate



#### 5. Implement beam search for decoding at testing time. 

Beam search decoding can be implemented as follows:

1. Algorithm Overview:
   - Maintain k best partial sequences at each step
   - Expand each sequence with top k probable next tags
   - Keep overall k best sequences after expansion

2. Implementation Steps:
   - Initialize beam with top k starting tags
   - For each timestep:
     - Get scores for all possible next tags
     - Expand current sequences with top k tags
     - Sort and keep k best sequences
   - Select sequence with highest overall score

3. Performance Comparison:
   - Compare F1 scores with greedy decoding
   - Analyze trade-off between accuracy and speed
   - Tune beam width k for optimal performance



#### 6. Implement conditional random field with Viterbi algorithm (for training and 

CRF implementation consists of:

1. CRF Layer Design:
   - Transition matrix for tag-to-tag scores
   - Emission scores from BiLSTM
   - Combined scoring for sequences

2. Training Phase:
   - Forward algorithm for partition function
   - Compute loss using negative log-likelihood
   - Backpropagate through entire network

3. Viterbi Decoding:
   - Dynamic programming for best path
   - Maintain backpointers for reconstruction
   - Return optimal tag sequence

4. Advantages:
   - Global normalization
   - Models tag interdependencies
   - Often better than local decisions

5. Performance Analysis:
   - Compare F1 scores with baseline
   - Analyze improvement in sequence consistency
   - Evaluate computational overhead

##### Performance analysis

- Strengths Comparison:
  - MEMM:
    - More stable training
    - More evident loss reduction
    - Smoother learning process
  - CRF:
    - Higher initial F1 score
    - Theoretically better at capturing label dependencies
    - Well-suited for sequence labeling

- Current Issues:
	- MEMM's relatively low F1 scores might require:
	  - Additional training epochs
	  - Architecture adjustments
	  - Feature representation optimization

	- CRF's instability suggests need for:
	  - Learning rate adjustments
	  - Batch size modifications
	  - Learning rate scheduling



##### Overall Assessment:

Both methods demonstrate learning capability but have room for improvement. MEMM shows a more stable learning process, while CRF, despite higher volatility, demonstrates potential for better performance ceiling. The choice between them might depend on specific requirements for stability versus potential maximum performance.

The significant difference in loss scales and learning behaviors suggests that different optimization strategies might be needed for each method to achieve optimal performance.
